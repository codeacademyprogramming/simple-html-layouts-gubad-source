        <li>In addition to his work on relativity, the physicist laid the scientific foundations for paper towels, lasers, and more common products. Albert Einstein is justly famous for devising his theory of relativity, which revolutionized.</li>
        <li>Albert Einstein is best known for his equation E = mc2, which states that energy and mass (matter) are the same thing, just in different forms. He is also known for his discovery of the photoelectric effect, for which he won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921.In addition to his work on relativity, the physicist laid.</li>
        <li>According to estimates by means of biographical data, Albert Einstein's IQ has been estimated to sit anywhere between 160 and 180.</li>
        <li>The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921 was awarded to Albert Einstein "for his services to Theoretical Physics.</li>
        <li>Over a 15-year period, Einstein perfected his theory of relativity, which tried to explain how everything in the universe works. His new theory gave better predictions of planetary orbits around the sun and a more nuanced explanation of how gravitational forces work.</li>
        <li>The great physicist Albert Einstein passes away in Princeton Hospital, New Jersey on 18 April 1955. ... Einstein refused to undergo further surgery, saying “I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share, it is time to go.</li>
